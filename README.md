### Online Voting System  
This project is a Java based Online Voting System designed to provide a reliable and secure digital election experience. Built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and MySQL for database management, the system supports key voting functionalities such as user verification, candidate selection, vote submission, and live vote tracking.

### Key Features  
**Secure User Authentication**  
The system supports both test access using hardcoded credentials and production-level login using a MySQL database. Each voter receives a unique voter ID that ensures secure identification and prevents misuse.

**Structured Voting Process**  
Users can vote by selecting a candidate from a predefined list after entering their details. The system automatically validates whether the user has already voted, ensuring the principle of “one voter, one vote” is maintained.

**Live Vote Counting**  
The application displays real-time vote counts for each candidate and updates instantly after every vote submission, enabling transparent and up-to-date election monitoring.

### Technologies Used  
- Java Swing (GUI)  
- MySQL (Database)  
- JDBC (Database Connectivity)  
- PreparedStatement (Security and SQL Injection Prevention)
